RAC-Hide is a dependency-free JavaScript implementation of *robust* image
steganography. A secret image is compressed to JPEG and embedded into the
**relationships between low-frequency DCT coefficients** of a cover image. The
result is visually indistinguishable from the cover and can be recovered after
the cover has passed through the lossy re-encoding pipelines used by messaging
apps and social platforms.

Everything runs locally: the library never uploads an image anywhere.

## Why coefficient *relationships*?

JPEG quantises every DCT coefficient independently, so absolute coefficient
values are not stable under re-compression. But if two coefficients receive
almost the same quantisation step, their **difference** is stable — quantisation
shifts both members in nearly the same direction. RAC-Hide therefore encodes one
bit as the *sign* of `C1 - C2` for a carefully chosen coefficient pair, and
actively pushes that difference away from zero by an adaptive **margin**.

That single idea, plus error-correction and interleaving, is what makes the
payload survive the channel.

## Pipeline

```
EMBED
  secret image ─▶ JPEG ─▶ 11-byte header ─▶ Reed–Solomon ─▶ bit repeat ─▶ interleave
                                                                              │
  cover image ─▶ YCbCr ─▶ Cb + spatial ruler ─▶ luma ─▶ 8×8 DCT ─▶ pair modulation
                                                                              │
                                                             IDCT ─▶ RGB ─▶ stego PNG

EXTRACT
  stego image ─▶ read ruler from Cb ─▶ normalise scale ─▶ 8×8 DCT ─▶ pair differences
                                                                          │
        search (ppb, repeat, nsym) ─▶ RS decode ─▶ header check ─▶ JPEG ─▶ secret image
```

See [`docs/algorithm.md`](docs/algorithm.md) for the full design, or the
[`src/`](src) modules — each one is self-contained and documented.

## Features

- **Anti-JPEG.** Payload lives in quantisation-robust coefficient differences.
- **Anti-rescale.** A resolution-independent *spatial ruler* in the chroma
  channel lets the decoder recover the original dimensions at any scale.
- **Blind extraction.** The payload is self-describing; no original cover and no
  side channel are needed.
- **Zero dependencies.** Pure ES modules, no build step.
- **Isomorphic core.** The `src/core.js` codec runs in Node, a Web Worker or a
  browser; only `src/browser.js` touches the DOM.

## Quick start

### Node

```js
import { buildPayload, embed, extract, capacityBytes } from 'rac-hide';
import { readFile, writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

// `imageData` is any { data, width, height } with RGBA bytes
const cover = await loadImage('cover.png');
const secretJpeg = await readFile('secret.jpg');

const options = { ppb: 2, repeat: 1, nsym: 48 };
console.log(capacityBytes(cover.width, cover.height, options), 'bytes available');

const payload = buildPayload(secretJpeg, options);
const stego = embed(cover, payload, options);      // -> { data, width, height }
const result = extract(stego);                     // -> { jpeg, ppb, repeat, nsym }
await writeFile('recovered.jpg', result.jpeg);
```

### Browser

```js
import { embedImage, extractImage, decodeImageFile, imageDataToBlob } from 'rac-hide/browser';

const cover = await decodeImageFile(coverFile);
const secret = await decodeImageFile(secretFile);

const { stego, secretSize } = await embedImage(cover, secret, { ppb: 2, repeat: 1, nsym: 48 });
const blob = await imageDataToBlob(stego, 'image/png');

const recovered = await extractImage(await decodeImageFile(blob));
```

### Run the demo

The demo uses ES modules, so it must be served over HTTP:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/demo/
```

## Operating points

| Preset     | `ppb` | `repeat` | `nsym` | Trade-off                                        |
|------------|:-----:|:--------:|:------:|--------------------------------------------------|
| `capacity` | 6     | 1        | 32     | Largest, sharpest secret; weakest against attacks |
| `balanced` | 2     | 1        | 48     | Recommended default                              |
| `robust`   | 1     | 3        | 48     | Strongest against compression/rescaling; smallest |

| Parameter    | Effect when increased                                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ppb`        | Capacity rises linearly; per-bit margin is spread thinner          |
| `repeat`     | Random-error resilience rises; capacity falls by the same factor   |
| `nsym`       | Corrects more errors; payload shrinks (RS rate `(255-nsym)/255`)   |
| `marginMin`  | Robustness rises, visibility rises                                 |
| `marginGain` | Textured blocks get larger margins (more robust, less invisible)   |
| `marginMax`  | Caps the distortion in high-energy blocks                          |

Capacity in bytes:

```
total slots   = (W/8) · (H/8) · ppb
codewords     = floor(total slots / 2040)
capacity      = floor(codewords / repeat) · (255 - nsym) - 11
```

## Robustness

Measured with the bundled test-suite and manual platform round-trips:

- Lossless for a clean embed → extract cycle, and for mild additive noise.
- The spatial ruler is recovered after proportional rescaling and JPEG/WebP
  re-compression.
- Survives aggressive JPEG quality reduction and rescaling on the `robust`
  operating point.

Known limits:

- **Cropping** breaks the lattice alignment and is not recoverable.
- **Watermarks / redrawing** destroy the signal.
- Heavily rescaled *and* heavily re-compressed images can exceed the error
  budget, especially on the `capacity` preset. Robustness is content-dependent:
  flat covers are harder than textured ones.

If the spatial ruler cannot be read, the extractor accepts the original cover
dimensions manually as a fallback.

The suite covers the RS codec, the DCT round-trip, interleaving, the spatial
ruler (including a simulated rescale) and full embed/extract round-trips across
several operating points.
